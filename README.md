# Expense-Tracker---Node.js-Project
. It is an application that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete their expenses, as well as view their expenses in different time ranges like daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.

The project is built using Node.js, a popular open-source JavaScript runtime that enables developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It uses various Node.js libraries and frameworks such as Express, EJS, and Mongoose.

Express is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. EJS, on the other hand, is a templating engine that allows developers to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that simplifies the interaction between Node.js and MongoDB.

The Expense-Tracker project uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store the expense data. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that provides a flexible schema and scalable architecture, making it an ideal choice for applications that require real-time data processing.

The application has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the different pages and functionalities. It provides a login system to ensure the security of user data and enables users to export their expense data as a CSV file for further analysis.

Overall, the Expense-Tracker Node.js project is a powerful and efficient tool for managing personal finances, and its open-source nature allows developers to customize and enhance it according to their specific needs.
